"Dear Friend,

I am Mr. Ben Suleman a custom officer and work as Assistant controller of the Customs and Excise department Of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs stationed at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos-Nigeria.

After the sudden death of the former Head of state of Nigeria General Sanni Abacha on June 8th 1998 his aides and immediate members of his family were arrested while trying to escape from Nigeria in a Chartered jet to Saudi Arabia with 6 trunk boxes Marked ""Diplomatic Baggage"". Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00(One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars).

xx
to US$55 Billion Dollars (ref:ngrguardiannews.com) of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one (1)box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as ""Precious Stones and Jewellry"" in other that its
content will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we (myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team) are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. 

However as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account
cannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.

Therefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to
move the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries"" which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. 

This business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.

Expecting your response urgently.

Best regards,

Mr. Ben Suleman",Fraud
"FROM HIS ROYAL MAJESTY (HRM) CROWN RULER OF ELEME KINGDOM 
CHIEF DANIEL ELEME, PHD, EZE 1 OF ELEME.E-MAIL 
ADDRESS:obong_715@epatra.com  

ATTENTION:PRESIDENT,CEO Sir/ Madam. 

This letter might surprise you because we have met
neither in person nor by correspondence. But I believe
it is one day that you got to know somebody either in
physical or through correspondence. 

I got your contact through discreet inquiry from the
chambers of commerce and industry of your country on
the net, you and your organization were revealed as
being quite astute in private entrepreneurship, one
has no doubt in your ability to handle a financialbusiness transaction. 

However, I am the first son of His Royal
majesty,Obong.D. Eleme , and the traditional Ruler of
Eleme Province in the oil producing area of River
State of Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in
respect of US$60,000,000.00 (Sixty Million United
State Dollars), which I inherited, from my latefather. 

This money was accumulated from royalties paid to my
father as compensation by the oil firms located in our
area as a result of oil presence on our land, which
hamper agriculture, which is our major source oflivelihood. 

Unfortunately my father died from protracted
diabetes.But before his death he called my attention
and informed me that he lodged some funds on a two
boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary
status. The lodgment security code number was also
revealed to me, he then advised me to look for a
reliable business partner abroad, that will assist me
in investing the money in a lucrative business as a
result of economic instability in Nigeria. So this is
the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move
this money from the security firm to any Country of
your choice for investment purpose. 

So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so
that the funds can be moved in your name and
particulars to any Country of your choice where it
will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had
intimated the security firm personnel that the
beneficiary of the box is his foreign partner whose
particulars will be forwarded to the firm when due. 

But I will guide you Accordingly. As soon as the funds
reach, I will then come over to meet you in person, so
that we can discuss physically on investment
potentials. Based on this assistance my Family and I
have unanimously decided to give you 30% of the total
money, 5% for Charity home, 10% for expenses, which
may arise during this transaction, Fax and phone bills
inclusive. The balance of 55% you will invest andmanaged for my Family. 

I hereby guarantee you that this is not government
money, it is not drug money and it is not money from
arms deal. Though you have to maintain high degree of
confidentiality on this matter. I will give more
details about the proceedings of this transaction as
soon as I receive your favorable reply. 

Please reply to my Email Address:obong_715@epatra.com
I hope this will be the beginning of a prosperous
relationship between my family and your family. 

Nevertheless if you are for any reason not interested,
kindly inform me immediately so that I will look foranother contact. 

I am waiting for your quick response. 

Yours faithfully,

TEL: +233 208216645
FAX: +233 27621073
Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not a
hoax mail and I urge you to treat it serious. This letter must come to you
as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a day that people meet and
become great friends and business partners.
My name is Mr. Godwin Akwesi, the present branch Manager of a bank here in
Ghana. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust
you with the information I am about to reveal to you. Like I said, I have
a transaction that will benefit both of us, as your assistance is required
as a foreigner. I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head
office, but last December I was asked to take position of a Manager of our
branch in Kumasi who passed on, so that was how I became the present
Manager and discovered a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an
account with total sum of $12,500,000 million that has not been operated
on for the past 4 years. From my investigation, I found out that this
account belongs to one Late Mr. Morris Thompson an American great
industrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in
the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31
2000, including his wife and only daughter.
You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got
during my investigation;
<http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/> and
//www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html
The account is escrow call account, a secret type of account in my bank
and no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,
the account has no other beneficiary. I have kept a close monitoring of
the account since then and nobody has come forward to ask about the money
as next of kin to the late Mr. Morris Thompson, meaning that no one is
aware of the account.
I cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and
that is why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and
share it with me. As the Manager of my bank branch, I have the power to
influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the
next of kin to the account, with the correct information concerning the
account, which I shall give you.
I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the
account, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to you.
There is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed
under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of
law.
If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to
share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.
Contact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel we can work
together, so we can go over the details.
Thanking you in advance and may God bless you.
Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I wait your urgent response.
You can as well contact me by phone the number is +233208216645.

"Dear Sir/Madam,

I am BONGIES ZULU from Cape Town, South Africa and I am an Executive
Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources
affiliated (created) to the Department of Minerals and Energy. First and
foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a
transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality
and prompt access reposed on this medium.

Be informed that a member of the South African Export Promotion Council
(SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade
exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I plea to seek
a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described
Hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top
secret because of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of two other top officials, we
have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling TEN MILLION FIVE
HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLAR, (10.5) which we want to transfer abroad with the
assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the
said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive
such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South
Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore
account hence your importance in the whole transaction.

This amount TEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLAR ($10.5m)
represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my
Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials
over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid
to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said
amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic
Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an
application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the
transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that, should you be
willing to assist us in this transaction that is 100% hitch free, your share
of the sum will be 25% of the $10.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation
and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part
provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your
area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of
this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will
not disappoint me.

Endeavor to contact me through above e-mail address or the fax number
whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will
enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to
assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment
of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and
guarantee that our share will be secured. And please remember to treat this
as very confidential because, we will not comprehend with any form of
exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once
again that, time is of the essence in this business.

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

BONGIES ZULU

"20 SILVER CRESCENT,
Enugu,Nigeria.

Compliment of the day

I am Joseph Cabutti the consulting auditor with one of the prime banks here
in Nigeria. My search for a trustworthy individual/firm has led me to
you. I came across your contact while looking for a worthwhile investments
or projects that I can be affiliated with. I am writing you this letter to
ask for your support and co-operation to carry out this transaction.

The proposition

An industrialist and a foreigner who was customer of my client bank, who
died on the 25TH JULY, 2000 in CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [Flight AF4590] with
the whole passengers on board. During the course of my auditing discovered
an account opened in the bank in 1998 by this great late NDUSTRIALIST who
died without a written or oral 'WILL' attached to the account. Since his
death, I further investigated with kin interest to see if I can get any
relative of the late industrialist but all has proved abortive as no one
has come to claim his funds and no other person knows about this account
or anything concerning it.

The account has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the CEO of
his company work with my client bank, he had a balance of $36,000,000.00
USD {Thirty six million united states dollars} which the bank now expects
a next of kin to claim as beneficiary, Valuable efforts are being made to
get in touch with any of the relatives but to no success. It is because of
the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any the next of kin
and the beneficiary. The management under the influence of the Chairman
and members of the Board of Directors of the bank, are making arrangement
for the funds to be declared ""UNCLAIMED"" and will be lost to the Federal
Government or subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for Arms and
Ammunition to further enhance the course of war in Africa. In order to
avert this negative development, I now seek your permission to have you
stand as a next of kin to late beneficiary so that the funds USD36m would
be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary next of kin. We
wish to start the first transfer with $10,000,000.00[Ten million] and upon
successful transaction without any disappointment from your side; we shall
re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance to your account.

I have secretly discussed this matter with a close confidant attorney whom
I must involve in order to assist us produce legal back-up documents which
would substantiate your claims and also enable us have a smooth and
successful transfer of the fund to any foreign bank account which you are
going to nominate. On this note, We have secured from the probate an order
of mandamus to locate any of deceased beneficiary and more so we are
assuring you this business is 100% risk free involvement you should not
entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized
within 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary
of the fund from the deceased. At the conclusion of the transfer 65% of
the fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total transfer sum,
10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5%
will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure during the
transfer process.

If this proposal is acceptable by you do not make undue advantage of the
trust we have bestowed on you, then kindly get to me immediately.

Please furnish me with your private Telephone and Fax Number for easy and
safe communication.

Respectfully yours,
Joseph Cabutti.",Fraud
"Dear Friend,

My name is Mr. Chris Swales and I work with a Bank here in 
London-England, The name of the bank is Barclays Bank. We had a 
Mr.Allen Duke, customer that had a deposit of US$4.8M (Four Million 
Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) before he died in a 
plane crash with his wife and only Child about 6years now (January 30,
2000) and since he died, we in the Bank here have been expecting 
his/her next of kin/relative(s) for the inheritance of the deposit, 
but none has surfaced.

The policy of the Bank however stipulates a limited time period for 
such inheritance to be made or the fund will be written off going by 
the record of the incident, the time limit for the claim is closing 
up. In this consideration, I am contacting you to seek for your kind 
understanding and sincere co-operation to claim this inheritance for 
our mutual benefit.

If you can stand as the next of kin in this project, success is 
assured because I am in possession of the personal file jacket of the

"Dear Friend,

Good day. I decided to contact you after I went through my father’s file. 
Hence we confide in you. we sincerely seek your assistance.

My name is Mr.Desmond Martin Olds the only son of Mr.Martin Olds, a wealthy 
farmer and senior politician with the opposition political party in my 
country, Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). Our wicked President Robert  
mugabe murdered my father, before I ran way from my country because I have 
become his next target to eliminate. My father was a fighter for Justice and 
a moving force in The MDC, a party wanting to end the several years of 
brutal Dictatorship government of President Robert Mugabe.

Here is my reason for contacting you. Before the death of my father, he  
deposited the sum of Ten Million US Dollars (US$10,000,000.00) with a 
security company,The money was deposited as a gem/precious stone in a metal 
trunk box to avoid seizure and much demurrage from the security  company 
organization. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new machinery and 
chemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho and 
Swaziland.

The government seized my father’s farms and bank account before his Murder. 
He told me everything concerning the funds while he was still in Alive. This 
is why I need your assistance in securing the funds there in your Country, 
so that I can arrange on how to come over to your country for the investment 
of the fund, I am willing to offer you 15% of the total fund for your 
assistance.as you may know that the financial law and regulations of the 
government does not give we assylum seekers financial rights to such huge 
sum of money. In view of this, The monetary policy/law does not allow such 
investment by an asylum seeker or refugee. Please, let me know if you can 
assist me, so that I can give you more details on how we shall proceed.


As I wait for your urgent Response, please treat this
information as top secret. Then u can also contact me through this 
alternative mail (mr_desmond3@yahoo.com.au)

Yours Sincerely,
Mr.Desmond Martin.",Fraud

"Good day,

    I am David Bryan, staff of Kleinwort Benson. I am contacting you
concerning a deceased customer and an investment he placed under our
banks management three years ago.

I am contacting you independently of our investigation and no one is
informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain
facts that I believe would be of interest to you. In the year 2003, the
subject matter; came to our bank to engage in business discussions with
our private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial
portfolio of Six Million United States dollars, which he wished to have us
turn over (invest) on his behalf.

In mid 2004, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to
make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Helsinki- Finland. He
directed that I liquidate the funds and deposit it with a security firm. I
informed him that my Bank would have to make special arrangements to have
this done and in order not to circumvent due process.

Cash movement across boarders has become especially strict since the
incidents of 9/11. I contacted my affiliate and made the funds available
to the security firm. I undertook all the processes and made sure I
followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds
deposited with the security firm. The Security Firm is a specialist
private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and
blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake
transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly
private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and
well-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was
deposited with the security firm.

The deceased told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his
arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we
had, this transpired around 25th of November 2004. In June last year, and
we got a call from the security firm informing us about the inactivity of
that particular portfolio.  I made futile efforts to locate the deceased.
I immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal
investigations department of Kleinwort Benson. Four days later,
information started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A
person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in
Canne, in Southern part of France. We were soon enough to identify the
body and cause of death was confirmed.  In his bio-data form, he listed no
next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us
means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a
name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.
This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful; we’ve used our
private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the
problem. It is this investigation that resulted in my being furnished with
your details as a possible relative of the deceased.

What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want
you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world
who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The
world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those
that occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should
have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.
There is Six Million United States dollars deposited in a security firm, I
alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one
unless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this
deposit for as far as my Bank is concerned.

My proposal: I now seek your permission to present you as a next of kin to
the deceased, as all documentations will be carefully worked to make you
the beneficiary to the funds $6,00 000 00 (Six Million United states
Dollar); I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct The security
Firm to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon
receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the proceeds 60/40.I would
have gone ahead to ask that the funds be released to me, but that would
have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the
deposit. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions am aware of the
consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this
project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be
vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete
this message and forget I ever contacted you.

 I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I
will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you
contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you
contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through
the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I
do not want any direct link between you and myself. My official lines are
not secured lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level
of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please
observe this instruction religiously.

Do not betray my confidence. Kindly send your response to my private

I await your response.

"FROM THE DESK OF MASSAN AHMED
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,
BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)
OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO.
Dear Sir,
              I am the manager of bill and exchange foreign remittance at 
the department of Bank Of Africa (BOA).
In my departmentn we discovered an abandone sum of $ 22.6 m US dollars 
(Twenty two  Millon six hundred thousand  US dollars) . In an account that 
belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family 
in a concord plane crash in the year 2000 in paris that almost took the 
whole life of the pasengeres on board.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his 
supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash 
leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my depar
tment now decided to make this  businness proposal to you and release the 
money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and 
subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don;t want this 
money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.
The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclamed after ten years, the money will be transfered into the Bank 
treasury account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin 
in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner 
and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in 
respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for 
expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for ;me and my 
colleagues.

Thereafter I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement 
accoding to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate 
trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank 
as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your 
bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and 
effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted.

   Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text 
of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this 
transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear 
as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. 
Trusting to hear from you immediately.
  Your;s faithfully,
  MR.MASSAN AHMED
(Bill and exchange manager)
  BANK OF AFRICA (BOA).

"Dear Beloved in Christ,
 
Please bear with me for sending you this just in case you are offended by it 
as I know we don't know each. It's my belief that I am doing the lord's 
bidding and what is truly right in his eyes and that is what gives me the 
courage to send this email to a total stranger like you. Before I start, I 
will need to warn you that this email might contain the most shocking and 
unbelievable piece of news you have ever had in your entire life, but I 
trust the lord to give you enough faith and insight to see the sincerity in 
my heart.
 
 
It is by the grace of God that I received Christ, having known the truth; I 
had no choice than to do what is lawful and just in the sight of God for 
eternal life and in the sight of man for witness of God & His Mercies and 
glory upon my life.
 
 
I am Mrs. Sandra White, the wife of Mr. Robert White, my husband was an 
expatriate Contractor with Chevron/Texaco in Kenya for twenty years before 
he died in the year 2003. We were married for ten years without a child. My 
Husband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before 
his death we both got born-again and dedicated Christians. Since his death I 
decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the 
Bible is strongly against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the 
sum of US$7.5 Million (Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) in 
a 4 year one-time fixed deposit account with a Bank in Europe . Presently, 
this money(with accrued interest) is still with the Bank and the management 
just wrote me as the next of Kin/beneficiary to the account that it has 
become DORMANT since no transaction has been operated on it since the 
completion of the 4 years and if I, as the beneficiary of the funds, do not 
re-activate the account; the funds will be CONFISCATED or I rather issue a 
letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf because of my 
condition(note that you need to activate this account) as I can not come 
over. Presently, I'm in a hospital in Kenya (I chose to remain here since I 
will die closer to nature and the lord) where I have been undergoing 
treatment for esophageal cancer. I have since lost my ability to talk and my 
doctors have told me that I have only a few weeks to live. It is my last 
wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations anywhere in the 
World that might be in need of it. I have already donated most of our wealth 
here in Kenya to our local church and our house after my death to an 
orphanage here in Kinshasha. They are all totalling almost 800,000 USD.  
Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my 
illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting futher this 
responsibility to any one of them any more. 
 
 
I feel you might still be in sin and not so committed to the good lord or 
you are not even a christian but today, this moment as you read this, open 
your heart as this moment shall become the turning point in your life. Why 
would a total stranger like me be sending you this, be telling you this and 
be offering this much. Beloved, to be sincere with you, I HAVE NO IDEA 
except, that I know that the lord's way are not our ways. I have come to 
conclude that's it's divine. Who are we to question him anyway as just by 
his breath he gave us life, so much...... Open your heart and see the beauty 
of his plans, his intentions, his wish for the world then it will become 
very clear to you why at this time I am dying and why at the same time you 
are chosen for this, you other than someone else. It's all part of the big 
picture of the kingdom that is to come. Tha all his followers will spend 
forever............
 
 
Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me Stand-in as the beneficiary 
and collect the Funds from the Bank. I want a person that is God-fearing who 
will use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the 
word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible 
made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this 
decision because I don’t have any child that will inherit this money and my 
husbands’ relatives are not Christians and I don’t want my husbands’ hard 
earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don’t want a situation where 
this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking 
this bold decision. I am not afraid of death since I know where I am going 
to. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. {Exodus14 VS14} 
says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will not 
communicate with you by phone in this regard because of my soundless voice 
and presence of my husbands’ relatives around me always. I don’t want them 
to know about this development as I know all they are interested in is my 
husband's wealth and not my health.
 
 
With God all things are possible.

rewards for both of us.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Ten Million,Five  Hundred 
Thousand US dollars (US$10.5m) only , in an account that belongs to one of 
our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in November 2001 
in a plan crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been 
expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot 
release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the 
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt 
that all his supposed next of kin or relation died along with him at the 
plan crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business 
proposal to you so that the money could be released to you as the next of 
kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since 
nobody is coming for it and i dont want this money to go into the bank 
treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank 
treasury as ""unclaimed fund"". The request for a foreigner as next of kin in 
this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner 
and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 
30% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the 
provision of a foreign account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred 
during the business and 60% would be for me.

There after I will visit your country for disbursement according to the 
percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this 
fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relation or 
next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name,your bank account 
number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective 
communication and location wherein the money will be remitted. Upon receipt 
of your reply,

I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application.I will not 
fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that 
you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have 
been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you 
receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.

"Dear

Please let this letter not to bring confusion to you. I 
know that we have not met either before but hear me from 
the dept of your mind. It is circumstances that made to 
send this to you.

I will introduce myself first to you, My name is Miss Joy Kem, I lost my mother, my hero and my lord Ms Kem a 
year ago. She was poisioned to death by her associate in 
business. She formed a company by one Mr. Philip Brown who poisioned her only to take benefit of the multi million venture. He was arrested immedaitely my mother died and he 
entered an agreement with my mother's brothers that I and the immedaite younger brother of my mother will represent my mother's interest in the company. After six months I was kicked out of the company because I said that we have to change the company's lawyer who I termed was part of the elimination of my mother. I did not know that they have changed all the company's document without my name appearing any where. I will have to let you know more detail on that but let me move to the point why I am 
contacting you.

I have been nick named bastard by my mother's relations, 
They have named me all source of names even calling me 
outcast because my mother is late, while my mother was the bread winner of the family. They have pushed me out of my mother's mansion and still want to eliminate my life.I got through the records of my mother account books three weeks ago while crying and meditating, which I beleive was inspired by the spirit of God, I discovered that there is a huge sum of money she deposited in a bank, which is $9,800,000. The note attached to the deposit agreement 
she made with the bank indicated that, the money was to be used to purchase machinery for the establishment of a new company of her own.

Please all I need from you is to do all you can to help me to get this money out of the bank. I have been to the bank where this money is deposited immediately, and confirmed the account most deligently. The bank told me that my mother informed them that the money was to be remitted 
to her company's costumer account abroad, which her costumer will provide to them but since then they have never heard from her nor the costumer. Now my mother is late. I don't want the bank to know that my mother 
is late. I told them that she is ill and appointed me to represent her in her affairs.

(1).I want you to provide an account where the money will 
be remitted into as my mother's costumer. (2).Make 
arrangement for me to leave here as soon as possible
(3).How much commission you will take for rendering the 
assistant?

My mother did not marry to any man, She had me as the only 
child while she was having an affair with the person that 
surpposed to be my father when she was 18 years and the 
man abandoned her and disappeared which forced her to 
remain single. Now I am 20 years and never saw my father 
for a day.I have no home now and my life is in danger. I 
don't have any one to run into. All the members of my 
mother family have turned their back on me because I 
demand for me right. They told me that I don't belong to 
the family. That I should go and look for my father, Whom 
I don't know. I have made trace to know my father without 
sucess. I want you to hear me from the inner most of your 
heart and accord me this help.

God will bless you for saving my life and future.

Best wishes,
Miss Joy Kem.",Fraud

Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you as a 

surprise and may offend your personality for contacting you without 

your prior consent and writing through this channel.I got your contact 

from a professional database found in internet while searching for a 

reliable and honest person that will be an anointed steward in a vision 

very dear to me.



I am Mrs. Alondra Jose-Carlos person from Puerto Rico 

undergoing medical treatment. I am married to Dr.  Kevin Jose-Carlos 

who was a gun runner supplying arms and ammunition to warring factions 

in Africa before he died in the year 2002.We were married for eleven 

years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for 

only four days. Since his after death, I decided not to re-marry or get 

a child outside my matrimonial home. When my late

husband was alive he  deposited the sum of  £ 11.8.Million (Eleven Million,

Eight Hundred Thousand British Pounds Sterling) with a Fiduciary company. 

Presently ,this money is still with the Fiduciary Company. Recently, 

my doctor told me that I would not last for the next

three months due to cancer problem.  Though what disturbs me most is my partial

paralysis. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to an

organisation or individual that will utilize this money the way I am going

to instruct here in. I want an organisation or individual that will use this to

fund, women and youth groups, victims of war, environmental protection,

charities, orphanages and widows . It is said that blessed is the hand 

that giveth.



I took this decision because I don't have any child that 

will inherit this money and as a part of restitution for the atrocities 

of my husband which I tacitly supported. I don't want a situation where 

this money will be used in an ungodly manner , hence the reason for 

taking this bold decision.



I am not afraid of death, hence I know where I am going .I know that I am

going to be in the bosom. If you consider yourself adequately equipped morally and

spiritually for this mission, please ,respond by letting me know your

"RE: COLLECTION OF FUND (US$25,000,000.00) UNDER SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT.
 
Pardon me if I have offended you by contacting you for such a big 
transaction through an ordinary letter which makes it suspicious 
considering the type of fraud proposals moving around the world today. 
 
However, I was advised to explain this transaction to you on a face 
to face meeting. I could not do this because of the situation in the 
world today not being sure of your reaction.
 
I am Jones Martin, a 
Consultant and Broker from Kingston Jamaica. I was hired by a Japanese 
Businessman to broker an investment deal between him and an oil company 
in Venezuela. This deal was executed in January, 2003 and matured for 
termination in January 2005. On maturity, the Japanese Businessman and 
the oil firm decided to terminate the investment in cash to avoid 
payment of investment tax which amounted to several tens of millions of 
US Dollars to the American Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 
 
A special 
arrangement was made between a top Japanese banker working with 
Japanese bank in New York, the Oil Company and the businessman to 
terminate the investment in cash payment under a fictitious name, with 
an arrangement to change it later with a power of attorney which they 
prepared and handed over to The banker.
 
I was directly involved, well 
paid and mandated to organized and carry out the deal. All the cash was 
withdrawn in June 2005 and transported to EUROPE by direct bank vault 
delivery to a finance company for safekeeping pending the collection.
 
The real content of the boxes was not declared to the storage as it was 
delivered as personal family treasure worth US$25M.The certificates for 
the storage, secret codes for the opening of the boxes and its keys 
were all handed over to me.
 
Mr. Takashi the Florida businessman was 
planning to go to Europe by August 2005 with me for the collection when 
the unexpected happened in Hurricane Katrina Mishap, a natural disaster 
which claimed his life and that of the top banker. This left me 
devastated and confused as I have not yet handed over the deposit 
details to the owner and the power of attorney prepared for the change 
which was signed was still with the banker in his office which was 
lost.

Since last December the diplomatic storage manager has been 
calling me to bring or tell the owner to come over for collection. 
Since then, I have been finding any reliable person to collect these 
consignments under special and well negotiated arrangement until I came 
across your details. Be rest assured that this transaction has been 
well organized, 100% safe, legal, and should be kept very 
confidential. 

Signify your interest by getting back to me via my 
email as soon as possible.

"FROM THE DESK OF  DR. JERRY BERRY
THE MANAGER OF AUDIT AND ACCOUNTING DEPT,
BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)
OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA-FASO.

I MAKE THIS APPEAL WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ANY FACTS OR OPINION
EXPRESSED BY ME ARE GIVING IN CONFIDENCE AND SOLELY FOR YOUR PERSONAL
INFORMATION AND USE.

I am DR. JERRY BERRY the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign
remittance department of my Bank. In my department I discovered an abandoned 
sum of US$12.5M,(Twelve Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with 
account number 14-2558-5976 that belongs to one of our foreign customers who 
died along with his wife and only daughter in a plane crash of Alaska 
Airlines Flight number 261 which crashed on 31 January, 2000. You can read 
more about the crash on visiting this site 
http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/

The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great 
industrialist and a resident of Alaska. It is therefore upon this discovery 
that I now decided to make this  business proposal to you and for our bank 
to release the money to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will 
send to you as the next of  kin or relation to the deceased for safety and 
subsequent disbursement  since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this 
money to go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill.

The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money  remained 
unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The money has now stayed more than four years 
and I am preparing documentaion to prove that this money has been transfered 
to our bank treasury. It will be between me and you only  that will know 
that the money is not transfered into our treasure.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by 
the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabé cannot stand as 
next of kin to a foreigner.In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering 
you 30% of the total  sum. 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other 
charges) likely to be incurred during the course of transaction, while the 
remaining 65% is for me.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email  the text of 
the application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for 
this money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thomson. I 
will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free 
and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements have 
been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soon as you 
receive this mail through the above email.

"Dear Friend,

Your first reaction to this mail will be total rejection, scare and maybe
disbelief, owning largely to the atrocities people commit these days.But
this mail comes from a devastated, sorrowful and emotional laden soul that
needs compassion from a kind and good spirited person to wipe away my
tears and appropriate my dream and humanitarian gesture.

As you read this, I don't want you to  feel sorry for me, because, I
believe everyone dies someday.,I am Al-Zarqawi Yusuf, A Oil merchant in
Dubai, United Arab Emirate ( UAE). I have been diagnosed with Cancer,
which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health.
It has defiled all forms of medicine; Right now I have only about a
limited to live, according to my Medical Doctor. I have not particularly
lived my life so well, as I never really cared for myself but the Oil
business.Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my
business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this
as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make
all the money in the world.

I believe when Allah  gives me a second chance and  heal me I would live
my life a different way from how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for
my healing I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my
immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends.
i want Allah to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have
decided to give arms to charity organizations and give succor and comfort
to the less privileged of the Tsunami and Hurricane Katrina Victims, as I
want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth so far, by
distributed some of this money to some charity organizations in
India,Hurricane Katrina victims in USA and other part of the world. Now
that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self
anymore.I once asked members of my family  to close one of my accounts in
Saudi Bank and distribute the money which I have there to charity
organization and to the less  privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan.  They
cashed the money but kept it only to themselves.

Hence I do not trust them anymore,as they seem not to be contended with
what I have left for them already.The last of my money, which no one knows
of, is the huge cash deposit of Thirty Five Million United States Dollars
( US$35Million)  that I have in the Vault of The Security Company as
family valuable since the year 2003 for safekeeping.I want you to collect
this deposit on my behalf and disburse it to the Tsunami Earthquake
victims in Asia for the less privileged. Please send me a mail to indicate
your wiliness to assist in this disbursement.

 I will set aside 10% for you for your time and efforts by notifying the
security company as soon as i hear from you.I need your urgent reply with
your full name and address, your Phone and Fax numbers and your
Occupation so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible
person to handle this project for himself and the rest of the less
privileged.I will also plead to you to always pray for me because only
Allah heals.

"KEEP CONFIDENTIAL PLEASE.
Attn: Sir/Madam.
This letter may come to you as a surprise but I really prayed to God to
help me choose somebody that will be my true partner, a person who has
a fear of God that cannot betray my remaining family and me as I don't
even know whom to trust so I allowed the spirit of God to lead me.
I am Mrs. Patricia Jonas Savimbi, wife to the late leader of the
National Union of the Total Liberation of Angola (UNITA) After
surviving more than a dozen assassination attempts, my husband, Savimbi
was killed four years later, in February 2002, in a battle with Angolan government
troops.
Two weeks before he died, he called me and reveals the existence of
US$16,400.000.00 (SIXTEEN Million, FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND 
United States Dollars) which he deposited as valuable items with a Finance and Security Company in South Africa.
This money was income my late husband accumulate from the sale of Gold
& Diamond with top member's of the National Union of the Total Liberation
of Angola.
When I heard the bad news of my husband's death, his trusted aid moved
me and members of our family out on hiding, but unfornately my elder
son and myself were caught and place under house arrest. Luckily to us, my
second son has escaped to South Africa through the border where he
reside as a political refugee.
So my reason of contacting you is because of the problem which my son
is facing in trying to transfer the money, the labour law of South Africa
does not permit an asylum seeker (Refugee) the right to financial
transaction.
This was the basic reason why I decide to contact you, so that you will
stand as the beneficiary of the fund. If we agree on this, then the
ownership of the consignment/funds and every documents will
automatically be changed to your name.
We are offering you 30% of the total money, as a commission for your
services, while 70% goes to my family, which we intend to invest
immediately we are being released from house arrest.
I am assuring you that this transaction is risk free, all we need from
you is your co-operation and sincerity of purpose.
You will be contacting my son Peter Savimbi on Email:
petersavimbi8@webmail.co.za  for more  details on how to conclude this
transaction.
I will wait for your response through my son, thank you and God bless.
In your email to my son Peter, kindly forward to him the following as
it will be used during the process of change of ownership:
1 You're Full Name

"Dear Friend,


With great pleasure I Mr. Donald Ofu Obidima, Credit control Manager of
a Bank (name upheld)is writing you in respect of a foreign customer an
Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum
corporation,Engr.Lee Seunghyo made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for
twelve calendar months valued
at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch.

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address
but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we
discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation that Engr.Lee Seunghyo died in Korean Air Flight 801, which
crashed in Guam on August 1997 with other passengers onboard. I
therefore made further investigation and discovered that Engr. Lee
Seunghyo died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next
of kin was fruitless.Also, he did not declare any next of kin
or relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit
paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my
Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the
end of each year.

Since the demise of this our customer, I have personally watched the
account with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved
abortive as no one has come to claim his FIXED DEPOSIT fund of
USD.$25million, [Twenty five million United States Dollars] which has
been with my branch for a very long time. Since his
death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward to lay
claims for this money asthe heir.

A member of our government trade delegation to your country gave your
impeccable profile to me. Hence I have decided to seek your co-operation
in this business deal due to the sensitivity of this transaction. It may
interest you to know that I am only contacting you as a foreigner
because this money cannot be approved to a local Bank account here, but
can only be approved to a foreigner with an account since the money is
in US Dollars. I have decided as a matter of urgency upon this discovery
now seek your permission to have you stand as next of kin to the
deceased Engr. Lee Seunghyo as No one has ever come forward to claim
this fund.

In accordance to Nigerian Law, fund deposited for a long period of time
without claim will be reverted to the Nigerian Government treasury if
nobody applies to claim this fund after a long period of time. I want
you to co-operate with me so that the fruits of this man's labour will
not get into the hands of some unsrupulous corrupt government officials
if NOT CLAIMED now. I have secured from the probate an Order of Madamus
to locate any of deceased beneficiaries. Hence I am contacting you with
this proposal.

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately the following
below:

1.full names and address
2.Date of Birth
3.Tel & Fax Numbers

So that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits
which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the
services of two Attorneys for drafting and notorization of the WILL and
to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration
in your favour for the transfer.

The Bank cannot release the fund from his account unlesssomeone applies
for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking
guidelines. I have almost resolved to finalize this transaction with
some money to secure documents in your name as the bonafide beneficiary
of this fund $25m which guarantees our safety and successful transfer.
With the above suggestion, It is reliable,safe and quick for transfer
process.

At the successful conclusion of this business, your goodself shall be
entitled to have 40% that is, USD$10m of the total money while I will
have 55% that is USD$13.750m and 5% that is USD$1.250m for
communications and other expenses. I am ready to invest a reasonable
percentage of mine into any viable business you suggest as a joint
partner.

Your response is highly imperative as this is a TWO-man business deal
transaction as I shall then provide you with more details and relevant
documents that will help you understand the transaction. I need your
assistance and co-operation to this reality as I have done my Home-work
and fine tune the best way to create you as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch
Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction with you
as the beneficiary to this fund. Your percentage will also be a source
of upliftment.You have absolutely nothing to LOSE in assisting me
instead, you have so much to GAIN. Be rest assured that this transaction
would be most profitable for both of us.

I will appreciate your early reply for commencement of business.Contact
me for acknowledgement by E-mail and whereby you are not interested,
please indicate in your reply so that I can seek for the assistance of
someone else.

"Dear Sir, A Very Good day to you I am Mrs Mariam Abacha. I got your contact from a close Associate of mine who works with the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and Industry who visited your country for an International Trade Fair upon my quest for a trusted and reliable foreign businessman or company. He however gave me the assurance that you can be trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude. Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present civilian administration, I have been subjected to physical and psychological torture by the security agents in the country. As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody within the country. You must have heard over the media reports and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in different security firms abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor for life. I will give you more information as to this regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to you due to security network placed on my day to day affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited the sum of US$35 million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name is withheld for now until we open communication. I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal directly with you as I am still under house arrest. I am seriously considering to settle down abroad as soon as this fund get into your account so that I can start all over again if only you wish, but if it is possible, just help me in diverting this funds into your bank account which will accrue you 20% of this fund. Please honesty is the watchword in this transaction. And should you accept my terms, kindly send me an email signifying your interest to my email box as this is only safe for me now so that we can commence communication immediately. And upon receipt of your message of interest, I shall give you a more detailed picture of things. In case you don't accept please do not let me out to the security as I am giving you this information in total trust and confidence.NO RISK IS INVOLVED AS IAM STILL IN CONTROL OF MY HUSBANDS AFFAIRS. I will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good faith. Please expedite action. Prefer all further correspondence be sent via presidentwifeng@indiatimes.com but please copy this email:profadams@ usa.com sincerely yours Hajia Mariam Abacha.",Fraud

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.

My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block an!

During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only survivin",Fraud
"Dear sir, It is with a heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in respect of the context below. I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest (heart attack) while on the seat of power. I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit; the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband's properties is under the authority of the family's lawyer Tony Musa. My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husband's wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the ""Personal will"" of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f! urther advise,! no relations or fr! iends of ours should be used; as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this ""SOS"" call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email: tony_m@lawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him (my Attorney) on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception.

"Happy Sunday everyone!

Wanted to take a moment to outline how things are going to look the next couple weeks 
while the semester gets underway with online classes. This info will be cross-posted in 
email & in Teams.

In the hope of reducing the risk of spreading the omicron variant through support center 
staff, we are reducing the number of people who will be working in person in Carnegie. 
As such:
1.	I will be working remotely for several weeks (end date not yet determined).
2.	There will be two ITCR leaders in Carnegie each day, rotating between Jerome, 
Clayton, and Greg.
3.	There will be two campus techs on duty in Carnegie each day on a rotating 
schedule; all others will be working remotely.
4.	We’ll have one imaging student working at a time in room 7.
5.	For all other student techs, we’ll have one working at the front desk in Carn; other 
students scheduled will be working either remotely or at the not-lead desk in the 
big room.
a.	The remote student should use the student2 account.
b.	The front desk phones should be logged into student5 & student6 – I 
expect student6 should be set to “do not disturb” most of the time.
c.	The classroom emergency phone should be logged into student4.
d.	The not-lead desk student/second remote student should use the student3 
account.
6.	Masks must be propertly worn at all times in Carnegie. You may only remove 
it to drink a beverage or eat something; you must be seated/stationary when 
doing so. (In other words, no walking around drinking from your water bottle.) 
Your mask must cover from above your nose to below your chin.
a.	I strongly recommend you wear an N95/KN95 mask or similar, until we’re 
past the omicron peak. If you need one, let me know. They can be safely 
reused by following some simple steps.
7.	There will be an all staff meeting scheduled in the very near future – please stay 
tuned for that info.
8.	From a support perspective, students may still walk-in to request assistance in 
the support center.
9.	Faculty/staff must have an appointment; these appointments are generated by 
campus techs after attempting remote support first. In other words: a faculty/staff 
member should not ask you to set an appointment on behalf of a campus tech. 
Make sure there’s a ticket entered and advise the user that the tech will set up 
the time with them.
10.	If you are feeling unwell for any reason, do not come to work. We don’t want 
germs spreading around, and this is NOT a case of “sharing is caring.” ??
a.	If you test positive at any time, please notify me ASAP in addition to 
notifying contacttracing@drake.edu.
11.	Remember to always include Allison and Sam in any communications where 
you’d normally contact me, especially in regard to scheduling related requests.

There’s a lot that’s changed lately, so I expect there will be a lot of confusion from our 
returning users. Here’s a short list:
1.	Microsoft MFA went live at the beginning of the month, replacing Duo.
2.	We have new/different tools for managing MFA settings for users that are part of 
Password Manager.
3.	myDrake and other services now require the use of MFA.
4.	MyDUSIS no longer exists and has been replaced by a tool called Self Service.
5.	A number of changes have been made to TeamDynamix services as they relate 
to Banner, myDrake, Self Service, etc – make sure you review the portal to 
familiarize yourself.
6.	Parent access to student information is changing, and ITS will NOT be able to fix 
their login issues; they will have to contact their student to fix access.

That’s the “quick” overview. Yes, I know it’s a lot. And yes, that means there’s more we 
haven’t yet covered.

As always, if you have questions, just ask! I’m available on Teams to chat anytime you 
need it.

If you are receiving this email, then you have expressed interest in the J22 travel seminar to South Africa 
(and Zimbabwe). 

I am Prof. Knepper, one of the professors for the class. The other professor, Herbert Moyo, is a 
Zimbabwean who teaches in South Africa. He will be with us for the entire trip and will also accompany 
us back to Drake, where he will serve as the S22 “Global Scholar in Residence.” 

The travel seminar will visit the cities of Johannesburg, Durban, and Pietermaritzburg in South Africa, as 
well as Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. (We will also spend much time in the countryside.) The focus of the trip 
is lived religion, which includes African Christianity, European/missionary Christianity, indigenous 
religion (especially sangoma practice), Islam, and Hinduism. We will visit many different places of 
worship. We will also spend some time working with students from University of KwaZulu-Natal (where 
Herbert teaches) on a photo-narrative project about lived religion. 

On Tuesday of next week (3/30), I will hold an informational session from 4-5 pm. Feel free to drop in 
any time to ask questions. Here is the link: https://drake-edu.zoom.us/j/82477311829.

"Greetings Members of the Drake Community,

Today marks the start of Black History Month. We center and celebrate the empowerment, 
achievement, and contributions of African American communities, not only as they manifest in the 
present and come to us through the past—but in terms of the hope they hold for our collective future. 

History matters. 

The origins of Black History month go back to the leadership of intellectual giant, Dr. Carter G. Woodson. 
Woodson established the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH) in 1915 
after participating in a national event to commemorate the 50th anniversary of emancipation. Dr. 
Woodson worked tirelessly throughout his life to promote widespread knowledge of Black history. He 
knew the past and future are connected, declaring the vision this way, “We are going back to that 
beautiful history and it is going to inspire us to greater achievements.”

In February 1926, Woodson’s ASALH sponsored the first week-long celebration of Black history. This was 
timing they chose, in part, because the great Frederick Douglass was born on February 12. Within 20 
years, Black communities all over the country turned a week into a month and then, in 1976, the first 
official presidential declaration of February as Black History Month was conferred. This declaration has 
been made every year since. 

It’s vital we all continue to learn about, lift up, and honor the endless contributions of African Americans 
to every aspect of U.S.-American life. Black history is U.S.-American history. 

It’s also important we insist on our rights and responsibilities to do just that! As political pressures are 
mounting all over the country—including in the state of Iowa—to limit how fully and honestly we talk 
about U.S. racial history in public life, we need to deepen our knowledge of African American life, joy, 
wisdom, sacrifice and struggle to be honored as full citizens and human beings.  We need to understand 
the ways history continues to resonate in the present. Just today a dozen Historically Black Colleges and 
University’s (HBCUs) received bomb threads. Black lives and well-being matter. 

It's also a joy to celebrate Black History and recognize the many African American people who are the 
Drake community, who make Des Moines what it is, who are Iowa. Black creativity, brilliance, and 
commitment are boundless. 

I want to encourage you to participate in the countless opportunities for celebration and 
acknowledgement that will be offered to all of us this month. 

Read about members of the Drake community in a story series called Voices of Drake. The first story in 
the series highlights Jazlin Coley–Smith, Director for Equity and Inclusion. Show up to one of the many 
events sponsored by the Coalition of Black Students. Learn about the Black suffragette’s courage to 
secure the vote. Spend an evening with Ty Marcellus (NuWorld Comics) who is creating a universe to 
rival Marvel’s. Join Dr. Brandi Brimmer to hear about southern Black women’s journey to secure 
freedom for themselves after the Civil War and what these legacies mean for us today. 

There is so much to learn, celebrate, and continue to share.

Finally, in appreciation of Black History month, an offering of poetry, shared by Provost Sue Mattison. 
This poem was written by Clint Smith who is an award-winning poet, writer for the Atlantic and author 
of New York Times bestseller How the Word Is Passed. 

Meteor Shower
by Clint Smith

I read somewhere that meteor showers
are almost always named after

the constellations from which
they originate. It’s funny, I think,

how even the universe is telling us
that we can never get too far

from the place that created us.
How there is always a streak of our past

trailing closely behind us
like a smattering of obstinate memories.

Even when we enter a new atmosphere,
become subsumed in flames, turn to dust,

lose ourselves in the wind, and scatter
the surface of all that rests beneath us,

we bring a part of where we are from 
to every place we go.

Key Points (as of this morning)
*	There are five students with confirmed cases of COVID-19 in on-campus isolation
*	There are 15 students with confirmed cases of COVID-19 off campus
*	There are 15 students in quarantine
*	79.8% of employees are fully vaccinated
*	70% of all registered students, 76% of students with at least one class in person, and 
86% of residential students have submitted their vaccination record
*	Securely report your vaccination to Drake
Upcoming OSHA COVID-19 Mitigation Requirements 
The Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is developing 
a rule that will require all employers with 100 or more employees to ensure their workforce is 
fully vaccinated or require any workers who remain unvaccinated to produce a negative test 
result on at least a weekly basis. OSHA will issue an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) to 
implement this requirement in the coming weeks. Once that ETS is issued, more will be known 
about the timeline for implementation and the specific requirements of the standard. 

Faculty, staff, and student employees who have not yet been vaccinated or submitted proof of 
vaccination are strongly encouraged to do so now so that the University is well positioned to 
comply with this new requirement once it takes effect. Any changes to Drake policies or 
protocols will be communicated to campus in a variety of ways, including through COVID-19 
Updates. Faculty, staff, and student employees should submit documentation using this secure, 
mobile friendly, and easy to use form. 

Drake Testing Options 
Students experiencing COVID-19 symptoms can be tested at no cost at the Student Health 
Center. Students should call 515-271-3731 before showing up in person. 

Drake administers PCR tests, which are the most accurate type of COVID-19 test. Due to the 
higher risk of producing a false negative result with an antigen test, the University strongly 
recommends obtaining a PCR test from the Student Health Center or seeking out a test site that 
administers PCR tests.

Faculty and staff experiencing COVID-19 symptoms must contact Chris Nickell, director of 
environmental health and safety, at chris.nickell@drake.edu to receive instructions on how to 
obtain a test at no charge from the University.

For more information about COVID-19 testing at Drake, please see the COVID-19 Testing FAQ.

Fall Break Status 
At this time, Fall Break remains scheduled for October 18 and 19. Given the rapidly changing 
impacts of the Delta COVID-19 variant on our community, Provost Mattison may move Fall 
Break to November 22 and 23 (Thanksgiving week) at her discretion, with Faculty Senate having 
consented to this potential change (Motion 22-01, August 5, 2021).

Student Vaccine Incentives Update 
Should Drake reach 80% of students with at least one class on campus reporting full vaccination 
by Sept. 24, 20 students will be awarded one-time (non-renewable) scholarships in the amount 
of $2,500. Currently 76% of students with at least one class on campus have submitted proof of 
vaccination to the University. Additional details can be found in this Aug. 6 message. 

Securely Report Your Vaccine
Submitting proof of your vaccination is highly encouraged so the University can make 
accurate and informed decisions about safe campus operations. Students, faculty, and staff 
should submit documentation using this secure, mobile friendly, and easy to use form. 

Face Coverings 
The University Face Coverings Policy remains in effect. Even if you believe everyone is 
vaccinated, this policy applies and will be enforced. It is important that we all consistently 
adhere to this policy to ensure we are protecting both ourselves and others within the campus 
community.

COVID-19 Symptoms
Please re-familiarize yourself with the CDC’s list of common COVID-19 symptoms. It is possible 
for fully vaccinated individuals to contract and spread COVID-19, so please be aware of changes 
in your health no matter your vaccination status.

Do Your Part 
It is up to each one of us to protect ourselves and each other. Employees and students living off 
campus who do not feel well must avoid coming to campus until they are healthy. Please 
continue to follow the University’s safety protocols: wear a mask and remember to wash your 
hands properly and often. By doing your best to avoid exposure to the coronavirus, you are 
helping save lives and medical resources for those who need them most. 

Minimizing the risk of COVID-19 infections is a shared responsibility. Drake’s plans are aligned 
and consistent with local and state guidance. The University follows recommendations from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Iowa Department of Public Health, and Polk 
County health officials.

Hello everyone, 

I hope you had a great start to your new academic year! I want to provide some information on 
an excellent opportunity to participate in some fantastic research this semester. Our 
Mathematics and Computer Science Department will hold our annual information meeting on 
September 10th at C-S 301. Everyone is welcome to stop by to meet with professors and hear 
about what great research topics you and your classmates can explore this semester. At the 
meeting, each professor will talk a bit about their projects, they will be available to answer any 
questions you might have about their projects, and you will be able to sign up to participate. No 
prior experience or specific classes are required for most projects, so it's a great opportunity to 
find new (or join your old ;) ) like-minded friends and make your resumes stronger and more 
distinct. This year, we have various projects; here are a few: Human-Centered AI and ML, 
analyzing the Iowa Youth Survey, Image Parsing for Robotic Applications, Data Science for 
Economics, Iowa State-wide Mathematics Transition Research in math education, Hopping 
Forcing on Graphs, etc.

Learn more about research at our department on September 10th at 2 pm!

Happy end of the semester! Thanks for all of your help in making this a great year in Goodwin Kirk! 
 
As we wind down, I wanted to send out a quick note regarding some recent vandalism on whiteboards. I 
have received some reports recently of individuals having their dry erase boards altered and wanted to 
address the building. 
 
As a reminder, it is a violation of the Residence Hall Handbook to deface the whiteboards in the 
residence halls. We are watching for those who are violating these policies and will be acting 
appropriately following the Student Code of Conduct. 
 
Please do not write on a board that is not yours, run fingers and hands through messages or drawings, 
or erase boards that are not your own. We appreciate everyone working together to make sure 
individuals and our community spaces are respected.  
 
Feel free to reach out if you have any information, questions or concerns.
 
Good Luck on your final exams and have a great summer!

You’ll be presenting to the class, the VPs at Wellmark, and the collection of mentors. No formal dress

The general expectation is that you’ll fill about 3 minutes with a presentation of your project. Assume 
the audience isn’t familiar with your topic. Describe what you did (or what you discovered). There will 
likely be a few minutes for Q&A afterwards.

"Hello     

I hope all is going well with you, I am just messaging you as you once applied or took part in our projects, so I thought you might be interested in our new upcoming opportunities, especially a funded trip to Colombia next month.

First off, thanks again for being involved with Gotoco! I write to you from Thailand, where we have just arrived with our first cohort of Trinity CertTESOL trainees—our first group since the pandemic began! We are planning exciting things here for the summer and have a host of other great global initiatives opening elsewhere too. 

There have been quite a few developments with our organisation and project in recent months. We are delighted to now be offering destinations across Europe for the summer (Italy, Spain, Germany, Poland, and more). We also do off-cycle and longer term opportunities in Thailand/Colombia.

Generally, over recent years, we have sought to offer opportunities in East Asia (primarily Mainland China, but also Hong Kong and Japan), but East Asian projects won't run this summer because severe COVID restrictions seem likely to remain in place and these make travel for programmes like ours very challenging. So, East Asian locations are waiting for a future time when COVID restrictions in East Asia relax.

Please read the two points below and be in touch if you'd like to be involved.

1. Final openings for mid-April funded trip to Colombia:

I am just messaging now because we still have a few openings in next month's fully funded Colombia opportunities. If you are at all interested please fill in this form and we can set up an interview. It is a fantastic programme, participants will be working with the YMCA charity in Bogoá, delivering English classes and getting Trinity CertTESOL trained (all funded and free). We have similar projects upcoming in May and June too. 

2. Summer programme list now published:

Our programme list is now published for all Gotoco'ers that have held a position with us for this summer. We have fantastic opportunities running this summer, across Europe (Italy, Spain, Poland, Germany, Switzerland..), Thailand, Palestine, & Colombia. At this link you can read up on all of them and advise us which ones you'd like to do.

If you wish, you can join us in Colombia from April and also summer somewhere else, so please take a look at the above opportunities to see if you are interested. 

A reminder on eligibility: these programmes are supported by the UK government, and are open for all UK and Republic of Ireland residents/citizens (including anyone on long-stay visas, such as student visas in these countries). On the programmes, you will teach English while working towards a funded TEFL certificate, your return flights, meals and accommodation are all funded. For those that aren't eligible through a link to the UK or Ireland, we are offering similar summer opportunities in the UK, so please join us in the UK this summer (check out the link above and advise us there if you are interested).

Thanks for reading this far. Looking forward to chatting soon!

Best wishes,

"Good Afternoon,

I hope you have a safe and fun St. Patties Day! I’m reaching out to see what your plans are for after graduation. Have your original plans changed? I wanted to provide an opportunity that you may not know about, pathway to becoming a leader of Marines!  As a college graduate, you can use your degree to become an officer in the United States Marine Corps.  Officers are leaders that use their education and experiences to train, develop, coach and mentor young Marines.


Do you like physical fitness, complex problem-solving, leadership, and decision making?


Do you seek to serve a purpose greater than yourself?

What do you know about Marine Corps Officer Commissioning Programs?

Marine Corps Officers are four-year college graduates who serve in leadership roles and can specialize in nearly any occupation available outside of the Marine Corps.  Officers are employed in management roles, typically providing guidance and oversight to enlisted Marines.

Officers have higher levels of responsibility than enlisted members, and also receive higher pay.  Starting salaries for full-time officers are typically around $55,000-$70,000 with increases tied to promotions.  This pay includes full medical, dental, life insurance. You getting a living allowance as well, which is based on your rank and zip code and is nontaxable. Expect to make near six figures by your fourth year.

Officer Candidates School is one of the premier leadership training courses offered in the world today.  Marine Corps Officer training has given students just like you the leadership skills and experience to go on to successful careers both in the Marine Corps and Corporate America.  If you are mentally, physically, and academically qualified you can apply for Aviation, Ground, or Law programs.  The Marine Corps has over 22 different career specialties to include everything from Public Affairs, Infantry, Intelligence and Logistics and more.

Do you want to find out more?  Call, text, or email me.  Go to the website to watch testimonials and videos from candidates and officers.  You can learn a lot from the website: www.marines.com/officer.
